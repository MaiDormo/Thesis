# Thesis Project

This repository contains the codebase for my thesis project, which focuses on video streaming and network traffic analysis. The project is structured into several parts, each with its own purpose and functionality.

## Server

The `server/` directory contains the main server scripts for the project. 

- `server.js` is the primary server script, responsible for serving video content.
- `server_from_paper.js` is an alternative server script based on a specific research paper (provide reference if possible).

The server directory also contains several Python scripts for data analysis and visualization:

- `combined_plotting_all.py` and `combined_plotting_cli.py` are used for generating plots from the collected data.
- `plotting_server_data.py` and `plotting_wireshark_data.py` are used for plotting specific subsets of the data.

The `server/statistics/` subdirectory contains various JSON and CSV files that hold statistical data related to the server's performance and the network traffic it generates. Examples include `stats_10MB.json`, `stats_3MB.json`, `stats_5MB.json`, `test_download_10MB.csv`, `test_download_3MB.csv`, etc.

The `server/videos/` subdirectory contains a bash script (`bash.sh`) for handling video content and the video content generated by it.

## Net_conf

The `net_conf/` directory contains `thesis_traffic.py`, a Python script used for simulating network traffic.

## Wireshark

The `wireshark/` directory contains CSV files with data captured from Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer used in this project to monitor the network traffic generated by the server. Examples include `test_10MB.csv`, `test_3MB.csv`, `test_5MB.csv`, etc.

## Streaming_stats

The `streaming_stats/` directory contains JSON files with statistics related to video streaming, collected during the server's operation.

The video used for testing can be downloaded at this link: [bbb_sunflower_1080p_30fps_normal.mp4.zip](https://download.blender.org/demo/movies/BBB/bbb_sunflower_1080p_30fps_normal.mp4.zip)

Please refer to individual scripts for more detailed information on their operation and usage.
